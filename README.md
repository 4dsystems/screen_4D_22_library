TFT_22_ILI9225
==============

This is a library for the ILI9225 TFT display products, forked from the screen_4D_22_library library.

### DO NOT USE - STILL IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT ###

This library works with the ILI9225 based 2.2" 176x220 TFT LCD shields commonly found on eBay. Note
that there is a commonly available 2.2" 240x320 TFT module very similar in appearance but using the
ILI9341 driver.
