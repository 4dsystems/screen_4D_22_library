TFT_22_ILI9225
==============

**v1.3.8, released 2018-09-30, Fix bug with direct drawLine call on ESP32** Credit: [Bolukan](https://github.com/Bolukan)

**v1.3.7, released 2018-03-18, Fix compilation error with esp8266 v2.4.1 package**

This is a library for the ILI9225 based 2.2" 176x220 TFT LCD shields commonly found on eBay, originally forked from the screen_4D_22_library library. The ability to use GLCD fonts has been added and the syntax has been changed to match the Adafruit libraries somewhat.

*Note that there is a commonly available 2.2" 240x320 TFT module very similar in appearance but using the
ILI9341 driver.*
