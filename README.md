## Introduction

This is a library for the ILI9225 based 2.2" 176x220 TFT LCD shields commonly found on eBay, originally forked from the screen_4D_22_library library. The ability to use GLCD fonts has been added and the syntax has been changed to match the Adafruit libraries somewhat.

*Note that there is a commonly available 2.2" 240x320 TFT module very similar in appearance but using the
ILI9341 driver.*
